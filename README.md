# Apple Music Win10 Installer

## How to

Run PowerShell, paste this command and press Enter.

```powershell
IWR -UseB "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SunsetTechuila/AM-Win10-Installer/main/DownloadAndRun.ps1" | IEX
```

## Why

Apple Music isn't officially supports Windows 10, but there are really no technical barriers. You just need to edit the manifest and it will install and work fine.

This script does everything automatically and provides a weekly check for updates and their automatic installation if available.
